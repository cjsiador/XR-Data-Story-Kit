# XR Data Story Kit

# What does this project do?

XR Data Story Kit turns datasets (CSV/GeoJSON) into interactive VR stories on a tabletop map in the VR. The project goal is to allow any users to load their Geo data into their Meta Quest 3 headset at runtime without the need to setup a development enviorment. There will be able to create their own stories by building their enviorment in vr.
