# XR Data Story Kit
**XR Data Story Kit** turns datasets (CSV/GeoJSON) into interactive VR stories on a tabletop map in VR. 
### Our Goals we aim for:
### 1) Resusable components (interaction, visualization, and data import)
### 2) Application is easy to use for scientists/educators. 
### 3) Cross-Platform Device support using OpenXR.
### 4) Ability to provide the tools for scientists/educators to develop their visualization and storytelling through the app without setting up a development enviorment.
### 5) Add the ability to view GeoData through Unity's ArcGIS.

## Description
It turns CSV/GeoJSON into an interactive VR narrative experience so scientist can explore spatiotemporal data without rebuilding custom apps. This would improve the visualization and enhance education with minimal Unity development knowledge.

## Installation
### 1. Install Unity Hub and Unity Editor Version 6000.2.2f1 with Android/Windows/Mac build support as needed.
