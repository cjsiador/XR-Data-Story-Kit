**XR Data Story Kit** turns datasets (CSV/GeoJSON) into interactive VR stories on a tabletop map in VR. It turns CSV/GeoJSON into an interactive VR narrative experience so scientists can explore spatiotemporal data without rebuilding custom apps. This would improve the visualization and enhance education with minimal Unity development knowledge.
 
#### Our Goals we aim for:
#### 1) Resusable components (interaction, visualization, and data import)
#### 2) Application is easy to use for scientists/educators. 
#### 3) Cross-Platform Device support using OpenXR.
#### 4) Ability to provide the tools for scientists/educators to develop their visualization and storytelling through the app without setting up a development enviorment.
#### 5) Add the ability to view GeoData through Unity's ArcGIS.
