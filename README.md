# XR Data Story Kit
XR Data Story Kit turns datasets (CSV/GeoJSON) into interactive VR stories on a tabletop map in the VR. The project goal is to allow any users to load their Geo data into their Meta Quest 3 headset at runtime without the need to setup a development enviorment. There will be able to create their own stories by building their enviorment in vr. 

## Description
It turns CSV/GeoJSON into an interactive VR narrative experience so scientist can explore spatiotemporal data without rebuilding custom apps. This would improve the visualization and enhance education with minimal Unity development knowledge.

## Installation
